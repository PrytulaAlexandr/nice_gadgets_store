# Nice Gadgets Store

As part of a collaborative team project, my contributions included developing a versatile product footer and slider that are easily integrable across various sections of the site. I meticulously identified and rectified errors, implemented modifications to the product card, and designed a custom 404 page. Additionally, I enhanced user interaction by adding a tooltip to the favorite button in the product card using the Radix UI library. This project leveraged cutting-edge technologies including React, TypeScript, Node.js, Zustand, Radix.UI, and REST API.
